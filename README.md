## Introduction
In this work we present an application to create a scene of 3D objects synthesized from 2D paper drawings and sketches. These 3D models can be moved around (rotated, scaled and translated) interactively using hand gestures with the help of Leap Motion.

This work reminded us of the magic pencil in the fictional television series [Shaka Laka Boom Boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaka_Laka_Boom_Boom#Plot), which has the ability to bring things drawn with it to life; hence the name.

Refer the [report](https://github.com/divyanshu-talwar/ShakaLakaBoomBoom/blob/master/Report.pdf) for a detailed description.

## Contents
* `UnityProject/` - contents of the unity application (which runs on the client).
* `input_sketches/` - `.png` images to 2D objects used as input to the application.
* `results/` - contains the 3D models, their screenshots, app screenshots and demo gifs.
* `scripts/` - contains the inflation and mesh generation (2D to 3D model conversion) and the server side scripts.

## Results
### Inflation (2D to 3D conversion)
